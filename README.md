**ARRAY**<br>
An array is a group of like-typed variables that are referred to by a common name. Arrays in Java work differently than they do in C/C++.<br>
Array can contain primitives (int, char, etc.) as well as object (or non-primitive) references of a class depending on the definition of the array. In case of primitive data types, the actual values are stored in contiguous memory locations. In case of objects of a class, the actual objects are stored in heap segment.<br>
`Syntax`<br>
int[] intArray = new int[20];<br>
